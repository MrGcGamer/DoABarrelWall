tweak credits
azzou for providing everything necessary to help me create the editable list preference panel to add as many images as i want, extremely big thanks to him, as without him also taking so much time out of his day to explain and answer my questions, this tweak literally wouldn't exist without him
gc for taking time out of his day to deal with my nonsense with libraries and root.plists, which of course, credits to his library libgcuniversal for making my life easier 
taki for the entire wsl setup, the backbone of this operation, because I don't linux anything in my life, also he needs to lose weight
