Because these people are more important than the tweak itself.

### Prologue

I find the Jailbreak community to be a strange place. It encapsulates much of how the rest of the world works and interacts with each other, in it's own place of a microcosm, and I think that it's important to acknowledge this. In such a diverse community as this, there will always be a conflict of ideas and beliefs in what methods are morally right and which are frowned upon, especially more in an somewhat unregulated marketplace. This is, as the rest of the world functions in nearly the same way, nothing special. But given my time here, it has shed some light on situations I didn't notice in the beginning.

The Jailbreak community has the same people that exist in nearly every online community that surrounds themselves on a usable product. In this case, these are generally the people I have noticed after some years.

- **Newcomers:** Those interested in what the community has to offer and usually start off asking basic questions.
- **Active Users:** Those that spend some time every day in the community to see what's new and to help others when they can.
- **Developers:** Those that provide a service for the community, most likely tweaks or a solution to an ongoing problem.
- **Piraters:** Those that are unable to pay for the tweaks provided by developers, either by choice or impossible for them to.

Before I started this project, I identified myself with three out of the four above, the last one being a very prominent one. I could have easily purchased the tweaks myself, but due to a lack of empathy and not fully understanding the process needed to create something of value, I disregarded the money as being far too expensive for something that did so little on a device.

I find myself fortunate that I was able to encounter a developer that open sourced their work heavily on Github. After sifting through their many repositories and reading through the code, I understood that tweak development is a skill in it by itself, that it is almost a stab in the dark given how little guides exist to get someone started. Setting up the proper environment is simple enough, but when it comes to getting started on an idea, it is slightly difficult to make sense of anything with a majority of the resources consisting of the offical [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/), a community-driven [wiki page](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page), this [header page](https://developer.limneos.net/) that provides nearly every single class dump of headers available to modify, and whatever up-to-date open source projects you can find. These resources are by far sufficient enough to create something, but without the understanding of how everything is pieced together, it can overwhelming even for those with prior programming experience, and this was the state I was when I examined these repositories.

I have since permanently removed every single illegitimate copy of every tweak off my device in August of 2020 after realizing that tweak development isn't as simple as it is.
