I find the Jailbreak community to be a strange place. It encapsulates much of how the rest of the world works and interacts with each other, in it's own place of a microcosm, and I think that it's important to acknowledge this. In such a diverse community as this, there will always be a conflict of ideas and beliefs in what methods are morally right and which are frowned upon, especially more in an somewhat unregulated marketplace. This is, as the rest of the world functions in nearly the same way, nothing special. But given my time here, it has shed some light on situations I didn't notice in the beginning.
